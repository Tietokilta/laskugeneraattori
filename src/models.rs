// This is implemented based on https://github.com/Tietokilta/laskugeneraattori/blob/main/backend/src/procountor.rs#L293
//
// InvoiceRow: Is VAT really necessary to account for? TODO(?)
// Invoice: due date TODO:
//   this is not prio 1, but implementation idea:
//   when creating new invoice is set to NULL, as we don't know if the invoice is valid
//   Set to date X when the treasurer accepts this invoice
//   the open question is: What is the date X? Have to coordinate with treasurer / is this even necessary
// - Having a massive enum for product units is necessary, just have it as string :D
// As one recipient has to be able to:
// - have different emails
// - have different addresses
// - have different bank account for payment
// - have different names even? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
// It would involve creating a quite overcomplicated schema with multiple many-to-many relations for not that much of benefit
// as this is anyways a free fill form where people can spam whatever information.
// if there were to be any stronger authentication (guild auth?) then this would change (read: not in the near future.)
// Invoices table with recipient name, email and account number
